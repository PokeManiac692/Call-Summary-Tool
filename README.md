# Call Summary Tool

### Description
**CLI tool that cleans and converts data from a .txt file to a csv file.** This tool takes a text file named `0912.txt` 
and cleans and reformats it to only include the table data. The data is then saved as `output.csv`, allowing the program to more easily perform data analysis.

This program also has functionality to get the **sum** of an entire chosen row.
